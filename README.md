This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The function `greeter` expects a string argument, but an array of strings is passed. This causes a compilation error because TypeScript's type system prevents incompatible type assignments. The solution involves either modifying the function signature to accept an array of strings or modifying the function call to pass a single string.
